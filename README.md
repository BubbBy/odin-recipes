----- INTRODUCTION -----

The current project is to create a recipe using HTML. In this project, I will demonstrate my skills 
in HTML Boilerplate, using <p>, <em>, and <strong> tags, working with text, using lists, and adding links and images. 
Finally, I will add a commit message for the project.
