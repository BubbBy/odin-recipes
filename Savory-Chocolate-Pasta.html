        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onions and minced garlic, and saut√© for a few minutes until they are soft and fragrant.</li>

            <li>Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and let the 
                pasta simmer until it is cooked to your liking, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, prepare the chocolate sauce. In a small saucepan, heat the heavy cream over medium heat until it starts to simmer.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped dark chocolate to the cream and stir until it is completely melted and smooth.</li>
            <li>When the pasta is cooked, drain off any excess liquid and return it to the pot.</li>
            <li>Pour the chocolate sauce over the pasta and stir until it is evenly coated.</li>
